# Week 7: Software System Design and Data Flow

## Overview

This week discusses the importance of system design and data flow planning. Even small data flow components within a system can entirely change the way software is written to support it. The material this week will cover helpful system design principles, introduce diagramming tools used to describe system design and data flow, and give you first-hand experience managing the data flow of a system.
