Many fields of study might relate to Software Engineering. SE is a very broad term and could encompass fields like Web Design, Mobile app design, server/cloud management, etc. However, the one I want to focus on is Game Design. I think that game design is interesting because its "scientific rigor" depends on your role and what kind of game you are developing. For instance, an artist or level designer of a 2d platformer wouldn't be much of an engineer, but the physics programmer on a realistic flight sim could be considered a scientist and/or engineer. They need to work with complex formulas with real-life and natural applications and apply them in a virtual setting. The scientific rigor here is not as intense as a civil or aerospace engineer; a physics programmer doesn't have any life depending on their product working properly. However, the methods and formulas they may use could be very similar nonetheless. 

Game developers and programmers must "engineer" and plan their projects from the ground up. They are required to make precise calculations and plan to engineer a working game.
