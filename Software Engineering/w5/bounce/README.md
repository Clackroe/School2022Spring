# Bonus Activity: Bouncing Shapes

## Introduction

In this activity, you will be finishing the HTML and CSS for a bouncing shapes animation. The main animation is already written for you, but your job is to implement a few new CSS classes and HTML elements to tie everything together. To complete this activity, you will need to carefully study the code already written for you. Most of the missing pieces are nearly identical to existing code, but to create the shapes that you want, you will need to add some extra effects.

## Task 1: Finish the HTML

- Open the `index.html` file in this folder.
- Complete `TODO 1` by linking the `style.css` file to the `index.html` file.
- Complete `TODO 2` by adding a `div` element for each shape you will be animating (square, triangle, and hexagon).
  - **Note**: You will need to add a `class` attribute to each `div` element with the value `shape`.

## Task 2: Finish the CSS

- Open the `style.css` file in this folder.
- Complete `TODO 3` by creating a classes for each shape.
  - **TIP:** There are many ways to creat the triangle and hexagon shapes, but here are a few CSS properties that may help in the process:
    - [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius)
    - [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)
    - [transform-origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin)
    - [clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)

## Submission Details

- On Canvas, submit the following:
  - A zip file of the entire `bounce` directory, renamed as your NinerNetID.zip (e.g., dgary9.zip)
    - **TIP:** If you are struggling to remember how to zip your submission, here's an example of how to do it from the terminal on Mac or Linux machines: `zip -r -X dgary9.zip .`
    - **TIP:** For Windows users who want to use their terminal to zip their submission, you can use the `7za` command. Here's an example of how to do it: `7za dgary9.zip .`
    - **NOTE:** In the above examples, `dgary9` is the NinerNetID of the student submitting the assignment and `.` is the directory that contains the files to be zipped, which is the current directory (`bounce`) in this case.
