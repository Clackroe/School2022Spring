# Week 2

## Overview

In this week, we will be discussing the importance of software engineering as a field. As you will see, small details in code like unit conversions and type incompatibility can have drastic consequences if not handled properly. This unit teaches you to pay attention to the details. The lab this week will require you to work with a partner to better understand the small details of types in Python, so start being social!
