# UNC Charlotte Second Year Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my second year projects at UNC Charlotte! This repository contains the code I worked on during my time at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. These projects represent an important milestone in my journey as a software engineer, as it is where my passion for the field first sparked and solidified my desire to pursue a career in software engineering.

## About UNC Charlotte Second Year

During my second year at UNC Charlotte, I had the opportunity to learn and explore various concepts and technologies related to software engineering. This included gaining proficiency in Git, collaborating with teammates, and pushing my knowledge to new heights. The projects in this repository reflect my growth and learning experiences during this period. The Git commit messages are all over the place, however I enjoy looking back at them.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured in a way that each class that I was taking is contained within its own folder. Inside each class' folder, you will find the relevant code, documentation (if any), and any additional resources related to that particular project. The structure ensures reletively easy navigation and access to specific projects of interest.

## Project List

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Intro To Artificial Intelligence**: [This class introduced me to the basics in AI algoritms and utilizing heuristic scores and speciallized algorithms to have a program operate autonomously. My favorite project was my implementation of the AStar Algorithm.]
   - [Link to the class folder](/IntroAI)

2. **Mobile App Development**: [This wasn't my favorite class, as it used Java and Android studio. I was not a huge fan of the technologies used. However, I learned alot about using Java, large codebases, and working under pressure.]
   - [Link to the class folder](/MobileApp)

3. **Software Engineering**: [This was my all-time favorite class up until this point. I learned to work in a team, use git, design complex systems and software, and present a project. Check out my group project! (In another repository)]

   - [Link to group project](https://github.com/Clackroe/GroupProj-3135)

4. **Web Application Design**: [I learned a lot in this class. The basics of Web Design on a fundamental level. We used bare JavaScript with minor JQuery, and basic HTML and CSS. While these aren't common practices in production, it has allowed me to excell in learning these new technologies quickly in my own time. (React, Typescript, Next.js, Node, etc)]
