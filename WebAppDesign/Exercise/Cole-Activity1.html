<h1>Web-Based Applications Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><strong>Xander Cole</strong> 
    <br>I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Ai, Robotics and Gaming. I am really excited about this course and can't wait to use my skills learned in this class to make my own sites in my free time.
    <br> <em>I chose this course to further my skills and learn a few new languages. I have also always wanted to know how websites work and what makes them tick. Additionally my friend told me about the style of project that we will use, it seems very interesting and applicable to real life.</em>
    </p>
<p><b>Xander</b> will be working with my friend who is also in this class, and we will be helping eachother keep up with the work and succeed.</p>
